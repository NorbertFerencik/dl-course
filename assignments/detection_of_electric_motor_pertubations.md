# Fault Detection of electric motor

* Create an audio dataset and choose a suitable method for detecting faults of  an electric motor.

* The output of the assignment is mode for detection of electric motor faults.

* Students must choose the correct procedure for recording the motor sound. (Hardware, Software etc.)  

 __!!! Important:__ students will work with a real AC motor during the assignment. In order to work with this model, they must receive a brief training on the safety of the model and the procedure for its commissioning and restoration. All other operations related to the operation of the model are strictly prohibited.

## Research goal and expected output
* __The aim of the assignment is to detect engine failure.__

* Implement CNN, RNN and LSTM for fault detection.

* Write an article describing the creation of the dataset, overview of the methods used and results of the experiments.


## Milestones

* __Week 4__ -  set up model audio recording using selected hardware.

* __Week 6__ - Record an audio of  a clean engine run and at three fault conditions in three different positions of recording.

* __Week 8__ - Prepare a theoretical overview of applied approach. Process the dataset so it will suitable for DL methods.

* __Week 10__ Train three types of neural networks for fault detection: CNN, RNN and LSTM.

* __Week 12__ Tune the networks and finish an article.
